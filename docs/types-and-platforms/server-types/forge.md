A [Forge server](http://www.minecraftforge.net/) can be automatically downloaded, upgraded, and run by setting the environment variable `TYPE` to "FORGE".

!!! example

    ```
    docker run -e TYPE=FORGE ...
    ```
    
    or in a compose file
    ```yaml
        environment:
          TYPE: FORGE
    ```

The overall version is specified by `VERSION`, [as described in the section above](../../versions/minecraft.md) and provides the same benefits of upgrading as new versions are released. By default, the recommended version of Forge for that Minecraft version will be selected. The latest version can be selected instead by setting the environment variable `FORGE_VERSION` to "latest". You can also choose a specific Forge version by setting `FORGE_VERSION` with that version, such as "14.23.5.2854".

!!! example

    ```
    docker run -e TYPE=FORGE -e VERSION=1.12.2 -e FORGE_VERSION=14.23.5.2854 ...
    ```
    
    or in a compose file
    ```yaml
        environment:
          TYPE: FORGE
          VERSION: "1.12.2"
          FORGE_VERSION: "14.23.5.2854"
    ```

To use a pre-downloaded Forge installer, place it in a location mounted into the container and specify the container path with `FORGE_INSTALLER`. To download a Forge installer from a custom location, such as your own file repository, specify the URL with `FORGE_INSTALLER_URL`.

In both of the cases above, there is no need for the `VERSION` or `FORGE_VERSION` variables.

!!! note

    If an error occurred while installing Forge, it might be possible to resolve by temporarily setting `FORGE_FORCE_REINSTALL` to "true". Be sure to remove that variable after successfully starting the server.
